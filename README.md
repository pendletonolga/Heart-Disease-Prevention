# Heart-Disease-Prevention
The project objective was to develop a machine-learning model to predict the likelihood of future heart disease in patients based on anonymous clinical data.
The dataset was obtained from National Institute of Health: BioLincc. 
Machine-learning algorithms developed for the project enabled a predictive model to classify individuals as being at risk for heart disease in the future.
The project revealed that characteristics such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure were among the most significant indicators for predicting heart disease thereby enabling more targeted prevention and intervention strategies.
